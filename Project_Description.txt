In this Project, we implemented the file scanner.l to create a scanner for 
GLSL programing language. It will transform the soure file from a stream of bits
and bytes into a series of meaningful tokens containing information.
There are some goals we need to do:

- Skip over white space
- Recognize all keywords and return the correct token
- recognize punctuation and single-char, two character operators, 
recognize int, float, and bool constants, recognize identifiers

All lexeme require to track the current line and columns numbers and
we have to update the scanner reads the file

There are handling errors like for checking report lexial errors for lengthly
identifiers and invalid characters, then it will report the error
